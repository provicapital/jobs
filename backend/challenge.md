# Backend Challenge

## Description
Your challenge is to build a piece of an API based on a product that you love.
It can be anything (e.g: Spotify, Netflix, WhatsApp, Airbnb, you name it). Choose a product that you love and surprise us -
you can even improve it with a feature that you would like to see. 

You don't need to code the entire API of the product, just a part (e.g: let's say you choose to clone Spotify, 
then you can code endpoints for an album, genre and artists) and implement business logic to its part of the API.

## Create a Node app
- [ ] it should use [Node] and [Express]
- [ ] it should be documented
- [ ] it should be tested using a test framework like jest, mocha or chai
- [ ] it should focus on code reusability, performance and security
- [ ] it should be open sourced on your github repo

## Extras
- [ ] authentication using [JWT]
- [ ] deploy it - good options may be [Heroku], [AWS] or [Digital Ocean]
- [ ] use [Postgres] or [Mongo] as your database
- [ ] use [Sequelize] or [Mongoose] as your [ORM]
