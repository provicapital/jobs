# Frontend Challenge

## Description
Your challenge is to clone a page or pages of a product that you love. 
It can be anything (e.g: Spotify, Netflix, WhatsApp, you name it). Choose a product that you love and surprise us - 
you can even improve it with a feature that you would like to see.

## Create a React app
- [ ] it should use [CRA] or your any other boilerplate
- [ ] it should show retrieved data from a server, public API or a mocked JSON using a http library
- [ ] it should be responsive
- [ ] it should focus on components and code reusability
- [ ] it should be open sourced on your github repo

## Extras
- [ ] design it using figma, sketch our other design tool
- [ ] authentication using [JWT] and have a login system
- [ ] create a [storybook] with your components
- [ ] tests using [jest]
- [ ] deploy it - good options may be [Firebase], [AWS] or [Netlify]
