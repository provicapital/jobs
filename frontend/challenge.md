# Frontend Challenge

## Description
Your challenge is to clone a page or pages of a product that you love while utilizing any CSS framework. 
It can be anything (e.g: Spotify, Netflix, WhatsApp, you name it). Choose a product that you love and surprise us - 
you can even improve it with a feature that you would like to see.

One of the extra deliverables for this challenge is to create a [storybook] with your components. Storybook is a tool for UI development that functions by documenting and isolating components for testing and reuse. Even though it's not required, we highly recommend that if you plan on adding it to your project that you try building it from the start and not after most of your project is already done. You can read more about this component-driven approach that Storybook enables over [here].

## Create a React app
- [ ] it should use [CRA] or your any other boilerplate
- [ ] it should show retrieved data from a server, public API or a mocked JSON using a http library
- [ ] it should be responsive
- [ ] it should focus on components and code reusability
- [ ] it should be open sourced on your github repo

## Extras
- [ ] design it using figma, sketch our other design tool
- [ ] Support authentication using [JWT] and have a login system/authenticated routes
- [ ] create a [storybook] with your components
- [ ] tests using [jest]
- [ ] deploy it - good options may be [Firebase], [AWS] or [Netlify]
